<p>Socog Bot is designed to assist users in editing documents on various

you invite Socog Bot to edit documents on these platforms, the bot will
internally store copies of each document you share with it. By using Socog Bot,
you acknowledge and agree to this data storage and processing. You retain
ownership of your documents, and Socog Bot's use of them is solely for the
purpose of providing editing services.</p>

<h2>3. Payment and Billing</h2>
<p>Our Service may involve payment for certain features or usage. Payment terms
and details will be provided to you separately through the Socog Bot website or
application. We reserve the right to change our fees at any time, but we will
provide you with advance notice of any changes.</p>

<h2>4. Content and Usage</h2>
<p>Socog Bot enables you to collaborate on documents and projects. You are
responsible for the content you share, and you agree to use the Service only
for lawful purposes and in compliance with these Terms and any applicable laws,
regulations, or guidelines. You will not use the Service to create, share, or
distribute any content that is illegal, defamatory, offensive, or infringes
upon the rights of others.</p>

<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All intellectual property rights in the Service, including but not limited
to copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, are owned by us or our licensors.

<p>The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without
warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to

warrant that the results obtained from using the Service will be accurate,
reliable, or meet your expectations.</p>

<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will we, our affiliates,
or our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or licensors be

inability to access or use the Service; (b) any content obtained from the
Service; or (c) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions
or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence),

possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to
have failed its essential purpose.</p>

<h2>8. Reliance on Bot Communications</h2>
<p>While we strive for accuracy, the information provided by the Socog Bot, including but not limited to pricing details and legal declarations, may not always be up-to-date, complete, or accurate. Communications from the Socog Bot, whether verbal or written, are intended for general information purposes only and should not be relied upon as the sole basis for making decisions without consulting primary, more accurate, more complete, or more timely sources of information. Any reliance on the material provided by the Socog Bot is at your own risk.</p>

<p>We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other visitor to the Service, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information on the Service, and we neither adopt nor endorse nor are responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, or statement made by the bot. Under no circumstances will we be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from your reliance on information or other content posted on the Service or transmitted to or by any users.</p>

<p>In the event of a discrepancy or inconsistency between the content provided by the Socog Bot and the official terms, promotions, or other information contained in or presented on the Service, the latter shall prevail. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor the materials posted in the public areas of the Service and to remove or edit any materials or content which we, in our sole discretion, determine to be in violation of these Terms or otherwise potentially harmful or offensive.</p>

<h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us, our affiliates, and our
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors harmless from

any way connected with (a) your access to, use of, or alleged use of the
Service; (b) your violation of these Terms or any applicable laws or
regulations; (c) your violation of any third-party rights, including but not
limited to intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or rights of
publicity; or (d) any disputes between you and a third party.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to the Terms of Service</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time at our sole
discretion. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated
Terms on the Socog Bot website. Your continued use of the Service after the
effective date of any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If
you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Service.</p>

them will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
United States of America. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Washington State to resolve any legal matter arising from these
Terms or your use of the Service.</p>
